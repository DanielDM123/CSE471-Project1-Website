    <!-- Format of the score file -->
    <article>
        <h4>Here is how we formated out score files:</h4>
        <p>The format of the score file is based on the format we used in step 5. We still use the score, instruments, and notes tags the same way. The main difference is what is stored in the attributes for each tag. In the instrument tag, we replaced the instrument attribute to the new synthesizers we created, like sawtooth and squarewave. We also added multiple instrument tags for each new synthesizer to showcase them. In the note tag, we added a new attribute called effect. This is where we would store the effects for the song, and each note tag can hold multiple effects at once by having each effect separated by a comma. For example, a valid effect attribute value can be “compression,reverb”.
